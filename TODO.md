# TODO

- s/`nggroup $CMD`/`ng$CMD`
	- i.e. `nggroup useradd` -> `nguseradd`
- distribute via [setuptools](https://python-packaging-user-guide.readthedocs.org/en/latest/distributing.html#configuring-your-project)
	- try to not require any dependencies (if possible)
		- or if so, bundle them properly
- abide by pep8
- tests set up in Python
	- make use of `python2 -m unittest tests.$TEST_NAME`
	- integrate in `mock`
- remove/make optional - user's name and email
- Python2
	- possibly Python3
- make easily importable into other scripts
	- i.e. web hooks etc
- user permissions
	- if run as `root`, or part of `%nggroup` it will run globally
	- if run as a user, it will run in the user's home directory
		- warns the calling script that they're running as a user
- don't  bother writing if no changes
	- test via i.e. SHA256 checksum
